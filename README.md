# Hypixel-Dupe-Tracker-3.0
NBT Dupe tracker on Hypixel Skyblock to avoid getting false banned.
Hypixel Dupe Tracker will look through any items code to check if the NBT data is broken. If the item is outlined in red, its a "dirty item" which means it could be duped. Note: only works in your inventory and AH (Client side)
